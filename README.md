<h1> Cars Details </h1>

<h3>An interesting app for CAR FREAKS! </h3>


<p>This site is my first assignment built in COMP2084 Server Side Scripting. 
It uses MVC 5, SQL Server, Entity Framework and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I love cars and I have good knowledge about cars and its details so I thought about making this project.</p>
<p> This app helps you find the car details of the cars you love and dream for. </p>
